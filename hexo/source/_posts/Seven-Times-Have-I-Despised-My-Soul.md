Seven times have I despised my soul:

The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.
第一次是当我看到她本可能达到一个高度，但是她却选择了顺从

The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.
第二次是当我看到她在瘸子面前跛行

The third time when she was given to choose between th hard and the easy,and she choose the easy.
第三是当我看到她在艰难和安逸的选择面前选择了安逸

The fourth time when she committed a wrong,and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.
第四次是当她犯下错误却安慰自己别人也会犯错

The fifth time when she forbore for weakness,and attributed her patience to strength.
第五次是当她忍受软弱却将忍耐归功于坚强

The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face,and knew not that it was one of her own masks.
第六次是当她鄙视丑陋的面孔时却不知自己也是那副面孔

And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise,and deemed it a virtue.
第七次是当她唱起颂歌，还以美德自诩
